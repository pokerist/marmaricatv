Marmarica TV IPTV Admin Panel - Public Assets

The following image files should be added to this directory for the application to fully work:

1. favicon.ico - A favicon for the application (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 pixels)
2. logo192.png - A 192x192 pixel logo for PWA support and app icons
3. logo512.png - A 512x512 pixel logo for PWA support and app icons

These files are referenced in index.html and manifest.json but are not critical for development.
The application will still function without them, though you may see 404 errors in the console.
